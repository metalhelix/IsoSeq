# IsoSeq 

---

This pipeline is based on the IsoSeq pipeline from PacBio. More info on that can be found [here](https://isoseq.how/). 
Unlike the PacBio pipeline, this pipeline is automated to run all the steps to processing IsoSeq data without intervention.

So far, only single cell IsoSeq data is supported. 

Documentation on how to run the pipeline can be found [here](https://stowersinstitute.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/sites/ComputationalBiologyPublic/SitePages/https---nf-co.re-isoseq-1.1.5-.aspx?csf=1&web=1&e=0fo68l)
